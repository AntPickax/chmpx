# CHMPX is inprocess data exchange by MQ with consistent hashing.
# CHMPX is made for the purpose of the construction of
# original messaging system and the offer of the client
# library.
# CHMPX transfers messages between the client and the server/
# slave. CHMPX based servers are dispersed by consistent
# hashing and are automatically laid out. As a result, it
# provides a high performance, a high scalability.
