CHMPX - Consistent Hashing Mq inProcess data eXchange by Yahoo! JAPAN

### Overview
CHMPX is inprocess data exchange by MQ with consistent hashing system,
and libraries for clients by Yahoo! JAPAN.
CHMPX is made for the purpose of the construction of original
messaging system and the offer of the client library. CHMPX
transfers messages between the client and the server/slave. CHMPX
based servers are dispersed by consistent hashing and are automatically
layouted. As a result, it provides a high performance, a high
scalability.
